### About Me
My name is Jacob Whitlow and I am computer science student at California State University, Fresno. After earning my B.S. in Computer Science I plan to attend graduate school and earn my M.S. in Computer Science. Alongside school I work as the Database Team Lead for iAgriculture DMS in Fresno, California. The work I do involves building and maintaining databases in Microsoft Azure, as well as building APIs to allow interaction with these databases. The languages and technologies I work with are Python, MSSQL, Microsoft Azure Service Bus, Microsoft Azure Data Queue, and anything else I need to learn to get my work done. While I do not actively work with these languages I do have a strong foundation in C++ and Lua from past experiences and projects. 



### Goals
My current long-term goals include graduating from college with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and attending graduate school to earn my Master's. I am now unsure of what part of industry I would like to work in once I complete my education, but it will likely be closely related to data science. I plan to return to training muay thai after I graduate college as I do not have the time for it between school and other projects. Ultimately, I would like to earn my black belt as that would be a huge personal accomplishment that would challenge me both mentally and physically. 



### Current Interests
My current interests include data science, machine learning, and just about anything that involves the organization and utilization of large amounts of data. The three things that are taking up most of my time are my work with iAgriculture DMS, research with the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Service Institutions, and Google's Summer 2021 Software Product Sprint. Aside from career related interests I spend time playing video games with my significant other (I highly recommend It Takes Two if you have another person to play it with) and riding motorcycles/dirt bikes.
