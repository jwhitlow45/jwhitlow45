## About Me

My name is Jacob Whitlow and I am currently working as the Data Science Research Team Lead for the California Irrigation Web Application Project in Fresno, California. The work I do involves building and maintaining databases in Microsoft Azure, as well as building APIs to allow interaction with these databases. The languages and technologies I currently work with are Python, MSSQL, Microsoft Azure Service Bus, Microsoft Azure Data Queue, and anything else I need to learn in order to get my work done. While I do not actively work with any of these languages I do have a deep understanding of C++ and Lua from past experiences and projects that I have built.

## Goals

My current long-term goals include graduating from college with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and eventually working as a Data Scientist somewhere in Silicon Valley. I plan to return to training muay thai after I gradudate college as I currently do not have the time for it between school and other projects. Ultimately I would like to earn my black belt as that would be a huge personal accomplishment that would challenge me both mentally and physically.

## Current Interests

The two things that are taking up most of my time currently are my work with the California Irrigation Web Application Project and Google's Summer 2021 Software Product Sprint. Aside from career related work I spend time playing video games with my significant other (I highly recommend It Takes Two if you have another person to play it with) and riding motorcycles/dirt bikes.
